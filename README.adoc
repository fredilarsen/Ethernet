= Fork of the Ethernet Library for Arduino =

This fork was created to fix a bug where W5x00 based Ethernet shields will in some cases force the Arduino to lock up permanently until both Arduino and network shield are rebooted.

The problem occurs while sending a UDP packet and an incoming packet arrives at about the same time. A loop in EthernetClass::socketSendUDP in socket.cpp will loop until SEND_OK or TIMEOUT is received, but this never happens so the loop will go on forever, locking up the Arduino. A code may be received, but this is typically RECV.

Fixing that function to detect this condition and return failure was not enough. The card would become unresponsive after this happening a few times, neither sending or receiving. So the code in EthernetUdp.cpp and utility/w5100.h/cpp was modified to do a reset of the network shield, but keeping and putting back the current configuration so that the Arduino sketches will continue working without re-initializing Ethernet.
